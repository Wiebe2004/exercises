* The standard duration for this exam is 2 hours and 20 minutes, but every student gets 30% extra time, so a total of 3 hours.
* There are multiple parts to this exam. Before submitting, check to be sure you have solved each part.
  * Question 1: Events - located within the subfolder 01-events
    * `assignment-event.md`: a description of the tasks necessary to complete question 1
    * `event.py`: a file to write your code
    * `test_event.py`: a file to write your own tests as required in the assignment description
      * you may add more tests to this file if you'd like to check your code more thoroughly
    * `basic_tests.py`: a file with some very basic testing included to check only superficial details like names of functions and parameters
      * any additions, deletions, or changes to this file will not be taken into consideration for the evaluation of this exam
      * do not write your tests in this file or they will not count
  * Question 2: Vaccinations - located within the subfolder 02-Vaccinations
    * `vaccinations.ipynb`: a notebook with the description and space to include your own code
    * `vaccinations.csv`: a file with data for your analysis
* Reminder: If you right-click or control-click and select Open Preview, markdown files look nicer on your screen.
* At the end of the exam:
  * When you are satisfied with your solution (or if you run out of time), compress all the required files into a zipped folder named `LastName_FirstName.zip` (with your own name).
  * The folder structure of the submitted solution must match the original folder structure of the exam.
  * You can upload your zip file in the Submission Zone in x.toledo.ucll.be.
  * Once you have uploaded it, download your submission yourself and check that all content is correct.
  * We cannot award points on the exam for files that are missing or illegible.
